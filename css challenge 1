        <h1>The coolest creature</h1>

        <p>The <em>Dog</em> is awesome because <strong>it is mans best friend</strong>.</p>
        <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers.<br> The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.</p>
<p>The dog is a pet animal. A dog has sharp teeth so that it can eat flesh very easily, it has four legs, two ears, two eyes, a tail, a mouth, and a nose. It is a very clever animal and is very useful in catching thieves. It runs very fast, barks loudly and attacks the strangers.</p>
